//Basic Variables Introduction

//VAR VS LET
//ECMA Script version 6 set as a standard in script languages to use let

//Global



//Browser Object Model, Java Script Window
//https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_window.asp



//let will be shown as undefined since it's not added as properties of global window


//Function
//we can use var and let however we want


//For loops


    //z is *not* visible out here

        //z is only visible in here (and in the for() parentheses)
        //and there is a separate z variable for each iteration of the loop

    //z is *not* visible out here



    //c is visible out here

        //c is visible in the whole function

    //c is visible out here


//Redeclatation


// let mylet = 2;
// console.log(mylet);



//Const

//const can not change values

// BUT Const can change values in object



//Add new element to const object is working too




//Functions with var and let




//All variables are equall if its about function creation
//Arrow function
//arrow function js example
//https://developer.mozilla.org/pl/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Funkcje_strzalkowe
//

//standard function


//arrow function




//standard writting


//More complicated functions
//We can not use this inside of setInterval scope



//Arrow function allows to access this



//version without


//shorter version


//version with =>


//version with => and removed {}



//Higher order functions
// higher-order function is a function that can 
//take another function as an argument, or that 
//returns a function as a result.


//option one


//option two


//option two with arrow function 
//when there are two parameters there has to be {}
//if one then not neccessary


//so


// 4 *2
// 3 * 4


//higher order functions on arrays


// map function
// passes values to do something with them
// creates new array




//find Max using vals1


//version with arrow function


//or version like that
//if b > a take a as biggest if not take b


//sum again



//fill functions



//this acts on current array
//array filled with 0

//this acts on current array
//array filled with randoms

//change the size of array now



//or

//types, defined and undefined and null variables, objects
