# HOMEWORK TASK

The aim of homework is to help you learn the JS language. For some of you excercises may be very easy, 
for some of you who are just starting using JS, they may be average or even hard. I want you to do this 
excercises to ecourage you to code for some time every day. It's the best practice way, not only to meet 
every week during the classes, but also work on your own. Please do your excercises on time and upload 
to upload@janszczesniewicz.pl. Feel free to send there your feedback.

# EXCERCISES:

1. Create 50 elements array and fill it with random of range (3,4)

2. Create a loop displaying numbers dividable by 3 and 9

3. Write a function accepting two parameters: One - type of action (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, roots); 
Two - input number.Create validation. If input of any is text -> "Error, only numbers are supported". 
Define each action and return the result. Test if everything is working.

4.Write a JavaScript program to sort the items of an array 1- ascending and 2- descending. I want you to try to do each 
thing in two ways - check the Clue section.

Sample array : var arrInput = [ 1,42,111,-25,746,2,56,-2];
Sample Output : [ -25, -2, 1, 2, 42, 56, 111, 746 ];

Clue:
At first try to use loops and if statements. You can have a look for the example here - https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-array-exercise-7.php
As a second solution of this excercise try to use ready JS functions. Check docs - https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_sort.asp

# EXTRA EXCERCISES (However I encourage to try them too)

5. Write a loop that will iterate through an array of alphabet chars(english) and return the result of each iteration as
output of Char and description if the char is vowel or consonant. Then add vovels to a new array and do the same with 
consonants in separate array. Check if new arrays are sorted alphabetically. If not, you know what is your next task ;) 
Output sorted arrays as well. If you want you can also try the options of UPPERCASE AND LOWERCASE (try to use map function). 
Return everything in console. By the end of semester I will show you React JS and we will make a client for C# API, where we will use
all JS features to render content on the page. 

example output: A | A is a vovel
                Vovels: ...
                Consonants: ...

                Vovels to upper/lowercase: ...
                Consonants to upper/lowercase: ...
                
6. Create and array of 5 class members objects (name, mathGrade, C#Grade, englishGrade, JSGrade, PythonGrade, RubyGrade). 
Set their names and marks in range of (1-6 (can be half like 2.5;3.5;4.5) and calculate averages for each of them. 
Basing on average, try to round the result to full number (basing on math rules) and later display the final grade word for each 
person basing on the table:

6 - excelent
5 - very good
4 - good
3- average
2 - not very good, start learning
1 - tragic


PLAN FOR NEXT CLASSES:

- more basic features of JS, introduction to regular expressions
- synchronous java script, ajax, async,await, 
- npm, babel, webpack
- intro to react and redux
